Below is the script which gives the list of failed jobs as well as update statement to disable the failed jobs:

USE MSDB
GO

--Declare Table Variable
DECLARE @FailedJobs TABLE
(NAME VARCHAR(500),
[MESSAGE] VARCHAR(2000),
LASTRUNDATE VARCHAR(500),
LASTRUNTIME VARCHAR(500))

-- Getting Failed Jobs
INSERT INTO @FailedJobs
(NAME,[MESSAGE],LASTRUNDATE,LASTRUNTIME)


SELECT 
    J.[NAME] AS [NAME],  
    H.MESSAGE AS [MESSAGE],  
    H.RUN_DATE AS LASTRUNDATE,   
    H.RUN_TIME AS LASTRUNTIME
FROM SYSJOBHISTORY H  
    INNER JOIN SYSJOBS J
              ON H.JOB_ID = J.JOB_ID  
  WHERE J.ENABLED = 1   
        AND H.INSTANCE_ID IN 
        (SELECT MAX(H.INSTANCE_ID)  
            FROM SYSJOBHISTORY H GROUP BY (H.JOB_ID))  
        AND H.RUN_STATUS = 0  
                            
 
  --Disabling the Failed Jobs
  UPDATE SJ
  SET [enabled] = 0
  FROM sysjobs SJ
       INNER JOIN @FailedJobs F
              ON SJ.NAME = F.NAME
